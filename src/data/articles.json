    "description": "Continually emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants pose challenges to clinical and public health interventions, necessitating sustainable approaches to real-time variant monitoring. This case study describes an innovative SARS-CoV-2 screening and surveillance program that demonstrates the utility of sequencing-based variant monitoring using self-collected saliva specimens. We conducted saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 screening in occupational settings in Omaha, Nebraska from December 2021 through November 2022. 8,372 saliva specimens collected from 1,480 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by extraction-free PCR, with 334 positive samples referred for whole-genome sequencing analysis. Program utilization, quality metrics, and sequencing outputs were compared across sites. Specimen quality was high across program settings, demonstrating the suitability of self-collected saliva specimens for PCR and genomic surveillance testing. Virus RNA sequencing successfully determined the variant strain in 83 and 67% of SARS-CoV-2-positive saliva samples collected in two program settings, demonstrating the successful integration of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for variant determination into screening programs in occupational settings using self-collected saliva with an extraction-free qRT-PCR testing method. We further demonstrate that the sensitivity and efficiency of variant analysis is dependent on the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff of the diagnostic assay virus gene target. Use of an optimized Ct value cutoff for sequencing referral is recommended. Community-based saliva testing programs can be utilized to enhance variant monitoring, and could be considered in the risk identification of other respiratory infections. This approach offers the advantages of a non-invasive specimen collection, no need for supervised collection by a healthcare worker, supply chain resiliency, distributable access, and scalability.",

    "description": "OBJECTIVES: To generate and employ scenarios of sentinel human and animal outbreak cases in local contexts that integrate human and animal health interests and practices and facilitate outbreak risk management readiness.\nMETHODS: We conducted a scoping review of past outbreaks and the strengths and weaknesses of response efforts in USAID STOP Spillover program countries. This information and iterative query-and-response with country teams and local stakeholders led to curated outbreak scenarios emphasizing One Health human:animal interfaces at sub-national levels.\nRESULTS: Two core scenarios were generated adapted to each of 4 countries’ pathogen priorities and workflows in Africa and Asia, anchoring on sub-national outbreak response triggered by either an animal or human health event. Country teams subsequently used these scenarios in a variety of local preparedness discussions and simulations. The process of creating outbreak scenarios encourages discussion and review of current country practices and procedures. Guideline documents and lessons learned do not necessarily reflect how workflows occur in outbreak response in countries at highest risk for spillover events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Discussion-based engagement across One Health stakeholders can improve sub-national coordination, clarify guidelines and responsibilities, and provide a space for interagency cooperation through use of scenarios in tabletop and other exercises.",
